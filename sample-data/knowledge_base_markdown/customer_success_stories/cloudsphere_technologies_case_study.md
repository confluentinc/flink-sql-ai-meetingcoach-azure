## Customer Testimonial
"InsightCRM has transformed how our sales and technical teams collaborate. Before implementation, we had a knowledge gap between our sales reps and technical experts that often resulted in misaligned expectations. The SalesCoach AI feature has been phenomenal - providing our sales team with real-time technical guidance during customer conversations without requiring a technical resource on every call.

What most impressed us was how quickly we saw results. Within the first quarter after full deployment, our win rates jumped significantly, and the quality of technical discussions with prospects improved dramatically. Perhaps most importantly, our customers have noticed the difference in our sales approach - they appreciate that our sales representatives can now speak confidently about technical concepts and provide accurate information without constant escalations."

## Executive Sponsor Commentary
"As CTO, I was initially skeptical about a CRM implementation actually improving our technical sales conversations. My concern was that oversimplification would lead to misrepresented capabilities. What changed my mind was seeing how InsightCRM's SalesCoach AI could present complex technical concepts accurately during sales conversations.

The system doesn't just provide canned responses – it intelligently pulls from our knowledge base and past implementations to guide representatives through technical conversations with accuracy. This has dramatically improved the relationship between our sales and engineering teams, as sales now comes to the table with technically sound proposals that don't require extensive reworking."
