- "We don't have time for another implementation project"
- "I don't see enough ROI to justify the change"

## Authority in Decision Process
The VP of Sales typically has significant influence but may need final approval from:
- Chief Revenue Officer (if exists)
- CFO (for budget approval)
- CIO/IT (for technical requirements)
