# Objection Response Playbook: Pricing Concerns

## Common Pricing Objections

### Objection 1: "Your solution is more expensive than what we're currently using."

**Listen for:**
- Comparison to current solution cost
- Focus solely on license cost, not total value
- Lack of specificity about budget constraints

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge the concern:** "I understand price is an important factor in your evaluation. May I ask what solution you're currently using for comparison?"

2. **Shift to total cost of ownership:** "When comparing solutions, it's important to look at the total cost of ownership, not just the monthly subscription fee. This includes implementation, ongoing maintenance, integrations, and hidden costs."

3. **Quantify business impact:** "Our customers typically see a 3-4x return on their investment within the first year through increased sales productivity, higher win rates, and improved customer retention."

4. **Provide specific metrics:** "For example, Meridian Financial increased their forecast accuracy from 61% to 89%, reducing costly resource misallocations. Their relationship managers also reclaimed 7.5 hours per week previously spent on administrative tasks."

5. **Offer ROI calculation:** "I'd be happy to work with you on a custom ROI analysis for your specific situation so you can see exactly how the investment would pay off."

### Objection 2: "CloudCRM quoted us $95 per user per month, which is less than your price."

**Listen for:**
- Specific competitor pricing
- Focus on per-user cost
- Lack of awareness about implementation fees

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge the information:** "Thank you for sharing that data point. It helps me understand how to frame our value proposition more effectively."

2. **Address hidden costs:** "CloudCRM's base price is indeed $95 per user, but their implementation typically costs between $15,000-$20,000 for a company your size, plus $195/month premium support that's required for priority service."

3. **Highlight value differentiation:** "Our all-inclusive price includes white-glove implementation, dedicated support, and advanced features like our SalesCoach AI that CloudCRM charges extra for."

4. **Present 3-year TCO:** "When you calculate the 3-year total cost of ownership, InsightCRM is actually 22% less expensive when all costs are factored in."

5. **Share competitive insight:** "It's also worth noting that CloudCRM just raised their Enterprise tier pricing by 12% last quarter, and we've heard from several of their customers that they're planning another increase soon."

### Objection 3: "We don't have budget for this right now."

**Listen for:**
- Timing of budget cycles
- Whether it's a genuine budget constraint or prioritization issue
- Decision-maker involvement in the conversation

**Response Framework:**
1. **Express understanding:** "Budget constraints are a reality for every business. Can you help me understand your current budgeting cycle?"

2. **Explore creative options:** "Many of our customers find ways to implement our solution even with budget constraints, either through phased approaches or by reallocating budget from less effective tools."

3. **ROI timing:** "Our typical customer sees positive ROI within 4-5 months, which means if you started now, you'd be cash-flow positive before the end of your fiscal year."

4. **Offer flexible terms:** "We have several flexible payment options, including quarterly billing, annual pre-payment discounts, and the ability to start with a smaller deployment and scale up."

5. **Suggest other budget sources:** "Some of our customers fund their CRM from marketing budgets due to the lead conversion improvements, or from IT budgets due to the reduction in legacy system maintenance."
