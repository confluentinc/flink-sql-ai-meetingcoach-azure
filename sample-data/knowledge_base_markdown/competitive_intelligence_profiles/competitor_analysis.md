## Handling Competitive Situations

### Best Practices
1. Never speak negatively about competitors - focus on our strengths
2. Ask questions to understand what specific competitor claims resonate with the customer
3. Use third-party validation (analyst reports, case studies) rather than just our claims
4. Focus on business outcomes and ROI rather than feature-by-feature comparisons
5. Offer customer references in the same industry who switched from the competitor

### Red Flags That a Customer is Favoring a Competitor
- Repeatedly mentions specific competitor features
- Becomes vague about timeline or next steps
- Starts asking for discounts to match competitor pricing
- References competitor-specific terminology
- Reduces the scope of their requirements to match competitor offerings
